Cryolipolysis (fat freezing) is a practical, non-surgical body contouring procedure that enables you to target the body areas that clients are bothered about the most. This revolutionary treatment can reduce stubborn fat by up to 26% in just one treatment. The areas that can be treated are upper and lower abdomen, arms, back, inner outer thighs and flanks. As the skin is vacuumed up with suction the cool energy is applied to destroy the fat cells under the skin. The controlled cooling means the skin is not damaged. Fat cells are destroyed and broken down which is then eliminated from the body’s natural lymphatic system. This is a great alternative to liposuction, with a non-surgical approach and zero downtime. This treatment does not require any prep, anaesthetic, recovery time. The procedure is non-invasive and does not carry with it the risk of infection.<br>   As well as Fat Freezing you will learn how to perform body contouring to tight-en and contour body areas.
